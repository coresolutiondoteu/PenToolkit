# PenToolkit

An advanced automated penetration testing script with various enhancements (future)

# Goals (DRAFT):

- modular, robust, and capable of handling multiple phases like network scanning, vulnerability detection, exploitation, and more
- modules would handle a specific phase like reconnaissance or exploitation, allowing for easier updates and maintenance
- integrating external libraries and tools for easier job
- vulnerability detection and exploit options recommendations
- exploit frameworks integration 
- logging and reporting
- error handling and retries came into play to ensure the script doesn't fail unexpectedly due to network issues or timeouts
- implementing try-except blocks and retry mechanisms with delays would make the script more resilient and user-friendly
- payload variety, adjusting payloads based on the target OS detection
- lateral movement within a network was another consideration
- persistence mechanisms were included to ensure the attack can continue even after initial access is lost
- anonymization techniques like spoofing user agents and routing through proxies, making the script more stealthy
- obfuscation techniques necessary to evade detection by security tools
- handling different OS environments
- privilege escalation was another part
- finally, cleanup functions were included to remove temporary files and logs post-execution
  
# Steps and Structure (DRAFT):

### **Phase 1: Core Script Structure**
**Objective**: Create the basic structure for the script, including modular functions for different stages (reconnaissance, vulnerability detection, exploitation, etc.).

#### Steps:
1. **Script Initialization**:
   - Import necessary libraries (e.g., `socket`, `subprocess`, `logging`, `argparse`).
   - Set up logging with timestamps and severity levels.
   - Define global variables for configuration.

2. **Module Structure**:
   - Create separate modules for each functionality:
     - `reconnaissance.py`: Network scanning, port detection.
     - `vulnerability_detection.py`: CVE database integration, service version detection.
     - `exploitation.py`: Exploit execution, payload delivery.
     - `lateral_movement.py`: Lateral movement within a network.
     - `persistence.py`: Persistence mechanisms (e.g., registry changes, scheduled tasks).
     - `cleanup.py`: Remove temporary files and logs.

### **Phase 2: Network Scanning and Reconnaissance**
**Objective**: Implement network scanning to identify targets and services.

#### Steps:
1. **Network Scanning**:
   - Use `python-nmap` or `scapy` for port scanning.
   - Identify open ports and services running on each target IP.
   - Log findings with timestamps.

2. **OS Detection**:
   - Use tools like `nmap` scripts to detect the operating system of the target.

3. **Service Version Detection**:
   - Detect versions of services (e.g., Apache, MySQL) using fingerprints.

---

### **Phase 3: Vulnerability Detection**
**Objective**: Integrate with vulnerability databases and detect known CVEs.

#### Steps:
1. **CVE Database Integration**:
   - Use the `python-exploits` library or a local CVE database.
   - Match identified services and versions against known vulnerabilities.

2. **Custom Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Write custom scripts to check for specific vulnerabilities (e.g., unpatched CVEs).
   - Automate exploitation attempts if a vulnerability is detected.

---

### **Phase 4: Exploit Framework Integration**
**Objective**: Integrate with exploit frameworks like Metasploit or Exploit-DB.

#### Steps:
1. **Exploit Database Integration**:
   - Use `msfrpc` (Metasploit RPC) to execute exploits.
   - Automate the selection of appropriate payloads based on target OS and service.

2. **Payload Delivery**:
   - Deliver payloads (e.g., reverse shells, binders).
   - Rotate payloads based on target detection (Windows, Linux, macOS).

3. **Post-Exploitation**:
   - Perform actions after gaining initial access (e.g., privilege escalation, lateral movement).

---

### **Phase 5: Lateral Movement**
**Objective**: Move laterally within a network to access additional systems.

#### Steps:
1. **Credentialed Access**:
   - Use stolen credentials or Kerberos tickets to access other systems.
   - Enumerate and exploit services on new targets.

2. **Uncredentialed Access**:
   - Exploit vulnerabilities in shared resources (e.g., SMB, RPC).

3. **Pivot Points**:
   - Establish pivot points (e.g., SSH tunneling) for extended access.

---

### **Phase 6: Persistence**
**Objective**: Ensure persistence on compromised systems.

#### Steps:
1. **Registry/Config File Manipulation**:
   - Modify system configurations to ensure reconnection after reboot.
   - Use tools like `Regshot` or custom scripts.

2. **Scheduled Tasks**:
   - Create scheduled tasks (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux) to execute payloads periodically.

3. **File System Changes**:
   - Add malicious files to startup directories (e.g., `Startup` folder on Windows).

---

### **Phase 7: Logging and Reporting**
**Objective**: Generate detailed logs and reports for each stage of the attack.

#### Steps:
1. **Logging**:
   - Log every action, including timestamps and results.
   - Store logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).

2. **Report Generation**:
   - Generate summary reports after completion.
   - Include findings like vulnerabilities exploited, systems compromised, and persistence mechanisms.

---

### **Phase 8: Obfuscation and Evasion**
**Objective**: Avoid detection by security tools and network monitoring.

#### Steps:
1. **Network Obfuscation**:
   - Use proxy chains or VPNs to hide the source IP.
   - Implement packet fragmentation to bypass DPI.

2. **Payload Obfuscation**:
   - Encrypt or encode payloads to avoid signature-based detection.
   - Use tools like `msfvenom` for custom payload generation.

---

### **Phase 9: Testing and Validation**
**Objective**: Ensure the script works as intended and handles edge cases.

#### Steps:
1. **Testing in a Lab Environment**:
   - Test the script in a controlled lab (e.g., GCP, AWS) with virtual machines.
   - Use tools like `burpsuite` or `tcpdump` for monitoring.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle network disruptions, firewall blocks, and system reboots.
   - Implement retries and fallback mechanisms.

---

### **Phase 10: Documentation and Refinement**
**Objective**: Document the script and refine it for usability.

#### Steps:
1. **Documentation**:
   - Write detailed comments in the code.
   - Create a user guide explaining how to use and customize the script.

2. **Refinement**:
   - Optimize performance (e.g., reduce resource usage).
   - Add error handling and user prompts for better interaction.
