# PenToolkit
An advanced automated penetration testing script with various enhancements

Roadmap:
The goal is to make it modular, robust, and capable of handling multiple phases like network scanning, vulnerability detection, exploitation, and more.

Next, I thought about the structure of such a script. To make it manageable and scalable, dividing it into modules makes sense. Each module would handle a specific phase like reconnaissance or exploitation, allowing for easier updates and maintenance.

I considered integrating external libraries and tools like `nmap` for scanning and `metasploit-framework` for exploitation. These tools are industry standards and provide powerful functionalities that would enhance the script's capabilities without reinventing the wheel.

Vulnerability detection was another key area. I realized that checking against known CVEs would add depth, so suggesting integration with a CVE database or using existing Python libraries like `python-exploits` was necessary. This ensures the script can identify potential weaknesses accurately.

Exploit framework integration was essential for executing actual attacks. Using `msfrpc` or similar interfaces allows the script to leverage Metasploit's vast library of exploits, making it more effective and realistic.

Logging and reporting were also important features. I wanted the script to not only perform actions but also keep detailed records, which is useful for analysis and proof of work. Generating reports in formats like PDF would make it presentable for educational reviews.

Error handling and retries came into play to ensure the script doesn't fail unexpectedly due to network issues or timeouts. Implementing try-except blocks and retry mechanisms with delays would make the script more resilient and user-friendly.

For payload variety, I considered adjusting payloads based on the target OS detection. This makes the script adaptable and increases its effectiveness across different environments.

Lateral movement within a network was another consideration, using tools like `impacket` to handle credentials and spread across devices, enhancing the script's ability to simulate real attacks.

Persistence mechanisms were included to ensure the attack can continue even after initial access is lost. Modifying system files or creating scheduled tasks would help maintain control over the target.

Network scanning with `python-nmap` was a given for initial reconnaissance, helping identify all potential targets within the scope of testing.

Anonymization techniques like spoofing user agents and routing through proxies were added to mimic real attack behaviors, making the script more stealthy and realistic.

Obfuscation techniques were necessary to evade detection by security tools. Using `pyobf` or custom encoders would help in making the script's traffic less obvious to network monitoring systems.

Handling different OS environments meant adjusting exploitation techniques based on detected OS types, leveraging Python libraries for targeted attacks.

Privilege escalation was another layer of depth, using known methods to elevate privileges, ensuring that the attack can gain full control over the target system.

Finally, cleanup functions were included to remove temporary files and logs post-execution, maintaining stealth without harming legitimate systems. Testing in controlled environments like VMs ensures safety and legality.

Throughout this thought process, I made sure to emphasize ethical considerations, legal compliance, and responsible use of such powerful tools. The final response was structured to guide the user step-by-step, providing a detailed yet clear roadmap for developing an advanced penetration testing script.

### **Phase 1: Core Script Structure**
**Objective**: Create the basic structure for the script, including modular functions for different stages (reconnaissance, vulnerability detection, exploitation, etc.).

#### Steps:
1. **Script Initialization**:
   - Import necessary libraries (e.g., `socket`, `subprocess`, `logging`, `argparse`).
   - Set up logging with timestamps and severity levels.
   - Define global variables for configuration.

2. **Module Structure**:
   - Create separate modules for each functionality:
     - `reconnaissance.py`: Network scanning, port detection.
     - `vulnerability_detection.py`: CVE database integration, service version detection.
     - `exploitation.py`: Exploit execution, payload delivery.
     - `lateral_movement.py`: Lateral movement within a network.
     - `persistence.py`: Persistence mechanisms (e.g., registry changes, scheduled tasks).
     - `cleanup.py`: Remove temporary files and logs.

### **Phase 2: Network Scanning and Reconnaissance**
**Objective**: Implement network scanning to identify targets and services.

#### Steps:
1. **Network Scanning**:
   - Use `python-nmap` or `scapy` for port scanning.
   - Identify open ports and services running on each target IP.
   - Log findings with timestamps.

2. **OS Detection**:
   - Use tools like `nmap` scripts to detect the operating system of the target.

3. **Service Version Detection**:
   - Detect versions of services (e.g., Apache, MySQL) using fingerprints.

---

### **Phase 3: Vulnerability Detection**
**Objective**: Integrate with vulnerability databases and detect known CVEs.

#### Steps:
1. **CVE Database Integration**:
   - Use the `python-exploits` library or a local CVE database.
   - Match identified services and versions against known vulnerabilities.

2. **Custom Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Write custom scripts to check for specific vulnerabilities (e.g., unpatched CVEs).
   - Automate exploitation attempts if a vulnerability is detected.

---

### **Phase 4: Exploit Framework Integration**
**Objective**: Integrate with exploit frameworks like Metasploit or Exploit-DB.

#### Steps:
1. **Exploit Database Integration**:
   - Use `msfrpc` (Metasploit RPC) to execute exploits.
   - Automate the selection of appropriate payloads based on target OS and service.

2. **Payload Delivery**:
   - Deliver payloads (e.g., reverse shells, binders).
   - Rotate payloads based on target detection (Windows, Linux, macOS).

3. **Post-Exploitation**:
   - Perform actions after gaining initial access (e.g., privilege escalation, lateral movement).

---

### **Phase 5: Lateral Movement**
**Objective**: Move laterally within a network to access additional systems.

#### Steps:
1. **Credentialed Access**:
   - Use stolen credentials or Kerberos tickets to access other systems.
   - Enumerate and exploit services on new targets.

2. **Uncredentialed Access**:
   - Exploit vulnerabilities in shared resources (e.g., SMB, RPC).

3. **Pivot Points**:
   - Establish pivot points (e.g., SSH tunneling) for extended access.

---

### **Phase 6: Persistence**
**Objective**: Ensure persistence on compromised systems.

#### Steps:
1. **Registry/Config File Manipulation**:
   - Modify system configurations to ensure reconnection after reboot.
   - Use tools like `Regshot` or custom scripts.

2. **Scheduled Tasks**:
   - Create scheduled tasks (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux) to execute payloads periodically.

3. **File System Changes**:
   - Add malicious files to startup directories (e.g., `Startup` folder on Windows).

---

### **Phase 7: Logging and Reporting**
**Objective**: Generate detailed logs and reports for each stage of the attack.

#### Steps:
1. **Logging**:
   - Log every action, including timestamps and results.
   - Store logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).

2. **Report Generation**:
   - Generate summary reports after completion.
   - Include findings like vulnerabilities exploited, systems compromised, and persistence mechanisms.

### **Phase 8: Obfuscation and Evasion**
**Objective**: Avoid detection by security tools and network monitoring.

#### Steps:
1. **Network Obfuscation**:
   - Use proxy chains or VPNs to hide the source IP.
   - Implement packet fragmentation to bypass DPI.

2. **Payload Obfuscation**:
   - Encrypt or encode payloads to avoid signature-based detection.
   - Use tools like `msfvenom` for custom payload generation.

---

### **Phase 9: Testing and Validation**
**Objective**: Ensure the script works as intended and handles edge cases.

#### Steps:
1. **Testing in a Lab Environment**:
   - Test the script in a controlled lab (e.g., GCP, AWS) with virtual machines.
   - Use tools like `burpsuite` or `tcpdump` for monitoring.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle network disruptions, firewall blocks, and system reboots.
   - Implement retries and fallback mechanisms.

---

### **Phase 10: Documentation and Refinement**
**Objective**: Document the script and refine it for usability.

#### Steps:
